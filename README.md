## Description:

### Music Theory Background
To figure out songs, you have to know each note in the melody. Some people are born with perfect pitch which means they can know exactly each single note played. But not all people or even musicians have the perfect pitch gift, so they use a different technique to figure out melody notes. This technique it called Relative Pitch. Instead of detecting single note, this technique depends on knowing the sound of each interval (The distance between two note) regardless of what the exact notes are.
