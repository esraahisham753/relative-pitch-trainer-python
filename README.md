## Description:

### Music Theory Background
To figure out songs, you have to know each note in the melody. Some people are born with perfect pitch which means they can know exactly each single note played. But not all people or even musicians have the perfect pitch gift, so they use a different technique to figure out melody notes. This technique it called Relative Pitch. Instead of detecting single note, this technique depends on knowing the sound of each interval (The distance between two notes) regardless of what the exact notes are. 

### What the app provides
The app introduces 5 training levels, each level contains the intervals of previous level and its own level. You can find the intervals and their levels in intervals.csv file.
You can customize your training session in various ways. Select the level (1-5), number of questions (1-100) and the direction of intervals (Ascending, Descending or Both).

## Run the app
1. I recommend creating a virtual environment for the project
```bash
python -m venv myenv
```
